# AP Physics 2
Taught by JK (initials)

## Highly recommend u to drop...

he teaches super fast and very hard to do his corrections
If you still want to do il give you some advice

### Record Audio
When JK's giving test feedback, record his audio using an ipad
or ul forget what he said in a few days

### Do corrections Immdediately
do corrections immediately after the test, do not wait until the last second
there will be a lot of people sharing the precious student hours

### Do Practice Exams
See the other folder i provided

### Attend Tutor
attend tutor for help

### Strategies Regarding Homework
If test is comming up and u don't want to bother about physics
just write i don't know
ul still recieve 70% and could do homework corrections later
go take pictures of JK's homework answers secretly don't let him see u
do this after school, during lunch break, thursdays after school and some other time
